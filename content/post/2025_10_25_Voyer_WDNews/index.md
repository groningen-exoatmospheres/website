<p style="text-align: justify;">
Maël Voyer and collaborators have published a new study unveiling the atmospheric properties of WD 0806-661 b, a unique, cold exoplanet which orbits a white dwarf, aka a dead star.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using JWST/MIRI Low-Resolution Spectroscopy, the team detected key molecular features of water, ammonia and methane that shed light on the planet’s composition, temperature structure, and cloud properties. This exotic system provides a unique opportunity to explore how planetary systems evolve after the main sequence of the host star. Their work demonstrates JWST’s exceptional sensitivity to faint, cold worlds and provides a benchmark for studying Y-dwarf–like exoplanets and white dwarf systems in the coming years.

Simon is a third-year PhD student and University Assistant at the University of Vienna. His research focusses on the observation and characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres. He performs end-to-end data reduction on observations taken by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and atmospheric retrievals based on Bayesian inference.

He currently works on the atmospheres of hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes, but his research interests also include the co-evolution of star-planet systems, interactions between host stars and their planets, and planetary habitability.

Quentin is an Assistant Professor at the University of Groningen. He studies the properties of exoplanet atmospheres, focusing on the analysis of observations with space telescopes such as Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). He is an expert of JWST spectroscopic observations that he uses to understand the nature and the origins of exoplanets by studying their atmospheres.

To analyse exoplanet atmospheric data, Quentin has developed a number of tools and new techniques. These tools allowed to conduct the largest systematic surveys on exoplanet atmospheres to date, extracting trends in the chemistry and physical properties for about 100 objects. Quentin is also deeply involved in the development of the ESA-Ariel mission, for which he leads the Synergy Ariel-JWST working group and the Retrieval working group. Ariel, which will be launched in 2029, will observe about 1000 exoplanets to answer the major questions of the field.

Maël Voyer is a third-year PhD student jointly supervised by Quentin Changeat at the University of Groningen and Pierre-Olivier Lagage at CEA Saclay. His research focuses on the data reduction and calibration of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations, particularly for the MIRI Low-Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) and NIRSpec instruments. Maël has developed several new correction methods to improve spectra of directly imaged substellar objects—exoplanets and brown dwarfs—addressing challenges such as inhomogeneous and time-variable backgrounds, persistence effects, and wavelength calibration offsets. He also works on the atmospheric characterization of these objects through advanced retrieval techniques, combining JWST data with state-of-the-art modelling tools. Maël is also part of the JWST GTO EXOMIRI team and the ESA ARIEL space mission through the JWST synergy working group.

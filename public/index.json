While originally not predicted to exist, they have been central to exoplanet atmospheric research since the field’s beginnings. Their high temperatures, inflated atmospheres, and strong irradiation also make them ideal natural laboratories for testing theories of atmospheric physics and chemistry under extreme conditions. Because they produce strong and frequent transit and eclipse signals, Hot Jupiters are among the best-characterized exoplanets to date. They provide insights into the diversity of planetary atmospheres beyond our Solar System. For our group, Hot Jupiters serve as benchmark targets for developing and validating advanced modeling and retrieval frameworks. Their rich spectra - obtained from missions like Hubble, Spitzer, and JWST - enable us to rigorously test radiative transfer models, chemistry, aerosols, and dynamical models against real data. By comparing retrieval results with forward models that incorporate processes like radiative forcing, chemistry, heat redistribution, and atmospheric dynamics, we refine our understanding of how complex atmospheric processes interact, and we improve predictions for future missions like Ariel. In particular, our group has developed pionering retrieval techniques to exploit the spectroscopic phase-curves of Hot jupiters. Because Hot jupiters are tidally locked, their atmospheres experiences extreme conditions, with temperature gradients between their permanent dayside and permanent nightside reaching thousands of degrees. This drives extreme dynamics that can be captured in phase-curves. Specifically, phase-curve consists in observing the planet along an entire orbite, essentially scanning its 3D thermal emission to construct maps of its atmospheric properties. The information from these data are crutial to providing initial conditions, forcing, and benchmarks to atmospheric dynamics models. Beyond their role as testbeds, Hot Jupiters are also key to addressing fundamental questions in planetary formation and evolution. Their inflated radii, orbital configuration, and observed atmospheric compositions provide clues about their formation and evolution. By studying these planets in detail, and importantly searching for correlations in their observed properties, we can understand their origins and extend our formation models to the solar system, and to smaller, cooler, and more complex worlds. In this sense, Hot Jupiter are the cornerstone of our group’s effort to bridge detailed atmospheric modeling with large-scale statistical insights into the nature of exoplanets.

Super-Earths are rocky planets, while Sub-Neptunes are gaseous planets with hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Transitional planets are of unknown composition: they typically fall in the size range of about 1.5 to 3 Earth radii, where the distinction between rocky planets and gas-enveloped planets becomes blurred. They are of particular interest because they may represent evolutionary stages between terrestrial and gas-rich planets - a key regime to understanding how planetary atmospheres form, evolve, and sometimes dissipate over time. One of the major challenges in studying small exoplanets lies in accurately determining their composition and internal structure: are they mainly rocky, gaseous, or even full of ice and water? Radius and mass measurements alone cannot definitively reveal whether such a planet is a dense rocky core with a thin gaseous envelope, or a volatile-rich body with a significant hydrogen-helium atmosphere. At ExoAIM, we study the atmospheres of these small exoplanets using spectra from JWST to determine their composition. This adds a third constraint that can help up differenciate these worlds. This small planet regime is difficult. It is compounded by observational uncertainties: current instruments often have limited precision in measuring small variations in planetary mass and radius, especially for faint host stars. As a result, even small errors can drastically alter interpretations of a planet’s bulk composition. We therefore work on understanding instrumental systematics as best as possible to ensure robust interpretation.\nStellar activity — such as flares and spots — also enters the equation: these effects can contaminate transit spectra, masking or mimicking atmospheric signals; especially as most of these small planets are studied around active M-type stars. We are therefore interested in studying the host stars and developing techniques to account for contamination effects. Additionally, the intermediate temperatures of these planets often mean that condensates and aerosols form in their atmospheres, flattening out spectral features and complicating retrievals of molecular abundances.\nStudying these transitional planets is challenging, but crutial to the advancement of our planetary understanding. Existing planet formation and evolution models struggle to explain the observed “radius valley” — a gap in the distribution of exoplanet sizes that separates super-Earths and mini-Neptunes - and the “Sub-Neptune desert” - a statistical lack of short orbit Sub-Neptune size exoplanets. Competing hypotheses, such as photoevaporation driven by stellar radiation and core-powered mass loss, each predict different evolutionary pathways for transitional planets and different atmospheric compositions. Disentangling these processes requires to study the atmospheres of many of these planets across a wide range of planetary ages and stellar environments.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1f20f65e1913a40b7154a9c6b2e457da","permalink":"http://localhost:54973/research/transitional_worlds/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/transitional_worlds/","section":"research","summary":" Transitional exoplanets are planets that occupy the intermediate range between the well-defined classes that are Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes.

As atmopsheres are complex systems, these models include components from many complementary areas of physics: radiative transfer, thermodynamics, chemistry, fluids, and orbital dynamics. Sucessfully combining these allows us to capture the wide diversity of atmospheric behaviors found beyond the Solar System. By coupling these models with observational data from cutting-edge telescopes, we seek to identify the key physical and chemical processes that shape exoplanet climates, from hot Jupiters with extreme irradiation to temperate terrestrial worlds. A central aspect of our work involves integrating modeling into atmospheric retrieval frameworks — the inverse methods that connect observed spectra to atmospheric properties. By improving the physical realism of these models and testing the assumptions underlying retrieval techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of inferred parameters such as temperature structures, molecular abundances, and cloud properties. This synergy between forward modeling and retrieval analysis ensures that our interpretations of exoplanet atmospheres are both rigorous and physically sound. At ExoAIM, we often combine information-oriented approaches (driven mainly by the data and using less physical assumptions) to state-of-the-art self-consistent modeling approaches (using physically motivated models) to test our level of understanding of exo-atmospheric physics. Beyond data-driven modeling, our group also investigates more fundamental and theoretical aspects. We model dynamics and radiative processes that govern atmospheric behavior from first principles. For instance, in recent works, we utilized idealized (but powerful) mathematical frameworks — such as the primitive equations or the shallow-water equations - to study the large-scale circulation patterns of exo-atmospheres under stellar forcing. These theoretical studies allow to probe how rotation, irradiation, and internal waves shape the global planetary flows. Importantly, we conduct these numerical explorations using high spacio-temporal resolutions (10-50 km grids with seconds timesteps) to resolve the shortest relevant scales. In parallel, we work on radiative transfer and energy balance aspects to explore how radiation interacts with complex atmospheric chemistry. Together, these studies advance both the theoretical and applied understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres, providing the foundation for interpreting the next generation of observations.

In atmospheric retrievals, millions of forward model---predicting what a planet’s spectrum should look like for a given set of atmospheric conditions---are tested to evaluate which sets of the free parameters best match the observed spectrum. At ExoAIM, we test for the effects of molecular absorption, scattering from clouds, and the temperature distributions. We use modern Bayesian statistical frameworks, such as Nested Sampling, to optimize our exploration: the model parameters are iteratively adjusted to find the best-fitting atmospheric state and provides probability distributions (posterior estimates). We have sucessfully applied these techniques on 100s of exoplanets, constraining quantities such as the abundances of water vapor, methane, carbon dioxide, and the planet’s temperature-pressure profile.

Using JWST/MIRI Low-Resolution Spectroscopy, the team detected key molecular features of water, ammonia and methane that shed light on the planet’s composition, temperature structure, and cloud properties. This exotic system provides a unique opportunity to explore how planetary systems evolve after the main sequence of the host star. Their work demonstrates JWST’s exceptional sensitivity to faint, cold worlds and provides a benchmark for studying Y-dwarf–like exoplanets and white dwarf systems in the coming years.
